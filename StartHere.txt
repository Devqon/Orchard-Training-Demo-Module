Hi there!


Good to see you want to learn the ins and outs of Orchard module creation. Reading code is always a good way for this!

We'll guide you on your journey to become an Orchard developer. Look for "NEXT STATION" comments in the code to see where
to head next, otherwise look throught the code as you like.

Head over to Module.txt. That file is the module's manifest; a Module.txt is required for Orchard modules. For more info 
see: http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/manifest-files


This demo module is based on Sipke Schoorstra's Orchard Harvest session (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH9mcodTX-U) and 
brought to you by the Orchard Hungary team (http://english.orchardproject.hu/).

This module was created with the code generation tool and the "codegen module OrchardHUN.TrainingDemo" command. For more
