Hello you!

@*
    This is a view template written in the Razor language (although not much to see from Razor here).
    Notice how when you open this page the above string gets injected into the layout.
    This file's path and name is determined by standard ASP.NET Core MVC naming conventions.

    If you've finished with both actions in the YourFirstOrchardCoreController, then
    NEXT STATION: Controllers/BasicOrchardCoreServicesController is what's next.
