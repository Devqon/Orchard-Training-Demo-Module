@* What we need to do here is to define an icon (by default the font-awesome will work with the TheAdmin theme) and
display the text. *@

<span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-users" aria-hidden="true"></i></span><span class="title">@Model.Text</span>

@* NEXT STATION: Go back to AdminMenu.cs where we left. *@
