@* There is an extensibility to create different editor shapes for content fields. This is a setting that
   every content fields have. When you attach a content field to the content part or content type you'll see an editor
   for the editor option. You can add new options by adding cshtml or liquid files with the
   [FieldName]-[OptionName].Option.cshtml pattern where you can specify your own option name and value. After this you
   can create the [FieldName]-[OptionName].Edit.cshtml to create your new editor. This way no coding is required so you
   can do it in a liquid theme as well. For detailed documentation see:
   https://orchardcore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/OrchardCore.Modules/OrchardCore.ContentFields/README/#creating-custom-editors
*@

@{
    string currentEditor = Model.Editor;
}

@* Now this is a default option with no value. We gave the name Hexadecimal. The ColorField.Edit.cshtml will be applied
    as the default editor shape. *@

<option value="" selected="@(string.IsNullOrEmpty(currentEditor))">@T["Hexadecimal"]</option>

@* NEXT STATION: Views/ColorField-ColorPicker.Option.cshtml *@
